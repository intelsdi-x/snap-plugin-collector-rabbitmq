# snap collector plugin - rabbitmq-collector
snap plugin for collecting metrics from a RabbitMQ node or cluster through the RabbitMQ
mamagement API. 

It's used in the [snap framework](http://github.com:intelsdi-x/snap).

## Getting Started
### System Requirements

* RabbitMQ node or cluster
* RabbitMQ management plugin loaded on a node or a node in a cluster
* Credentials for reading from the RabbitMQ node or cluster

### Operating Systems
All operating systems currently supported by snap:
* Linux/amd64
* Darwin/amd64

### Installation
#### Download the rabbitmq-collector plugin binary
You can get the pre-built binaries for your OS and architecture at plugins's [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-rabbitmq/releases) page.

#### To build the plugin binary
Clone repo into `$GOPATH/src/github.com/intelsdi-x/`:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-rabbitmq.git
```

Build the plugin by running make within the cloned repo:

```
$ cd $GOPATH/src/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-rabbitmq
$ make
```

This builds the plugin in `./build/`


### Configuration and Usage
* Set up the [snap framework](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/README.md#getting-started)
* The url, user, and password for accessing the RabbitMQ Management API to gather metrics from. The url,
user, and password can be passed via config to the snap framework on start or via the task manifest as part
of the config for the metrics to collect.
